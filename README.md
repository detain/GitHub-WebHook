This script acts as a web hook for [GitHub](https://github.com/) events, processes them,
and returns messages which can be sent out to an IRC channel or a Discord webhook,
depending on the converter used.

See `examples/discord.php` for a basic application that sends webhooks to Discord.  
See `examples/irker.php` for a basic application that sends messages to IRC.  

## GitHubWebHook
`GitHubWebHook.php` accepts, processes and validates an event,
it also can make sure that the event came from a GitHub server.

Functions in this class are:

#### ProcessRequest()
Accepts an event, throws `Exception` on error.

#### GetEventType()
Returns event type.
See https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events for a list of events.

#### GetPayload()
Returns decoded JSON payload as an object.

#### GetFullRepositoryName()
Returns full name of the repository for which an event was sent for.

#### ValidateHubSignature( $SecretKey )
Retuns true if HMAC hex digest of the payload matches GitHub's, false otherwise.

#### ~~ValidateIPAddress()~~
Returns true if a request came from GitHub's IP range, false otherwise.
âš  Use `ValidateHubSignature` instead.

## IrcConverter
`IrcConverter.php` accepts input from previous script and outputs
a colored string which can be sent to IRC.

#### __construct( $EventType, $Payload )
`IrcConverter` constructor takes 3 paramaters (last one is optional).
All you need to do is pass data after parsing the message with `GitHubWebHook`
like so: `new IrcConverter( $Hook->GetEventType(), $Hook->GetPayload() );`

URL shortener paramater takes a function, and that function should accept
a single string argument containing an url. If your function fails to
shorten an url or do anything with it, your function must return the
original url back.

#### GetMessage()
After calling the constructor, using this function will return
a string which can be sent to an IRC server.

Throws `NotImplementedException` when you pass an event that
is not parsed anyhow, and throws `IgnoredEventException` for
`fork`, `watch` and `status` events which are ignored by design.
